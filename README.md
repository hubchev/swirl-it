# swirl-it
I host my swirl courses here. 

## Installation 
install.packages("swirl")
library("swirl")
install_course_github("hubchev", "swirl-it")
swirl()

If the course has failed to install, 
you can try to download the file swirl-it.swc
 from https://github.com/hubchev/swirl-it and
 install the course with install_course().
